    <p>This is my <a href="greentext.html" class="plain-link">space</a> to practice,
      <br>be creative and build my own projects from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>This is my first attempt at creating a website since 2012. 
      <br>The last one I created was for a school assignment.

    <h2>Precision is my craft.</h2>
    <p>
      As a master watchmaker, I value accuracy, patience, 
      <br>
      and a keen eye for detail above all else.
      <br>
      This shapes me both professionally and personally.
      <br>
      In addition to watchmaking, I am interested in IT, music, 
      and <a href="greentext.html">coffee</a> culture.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am fascinated by the combination of mechanics and modern technology,
      <br>
      and I find it exciting to see how systems are put together and how they work.
      <br>
      This curiosity has been with me for a long time and is constantly growing.
      <br>
      I look forward to the exchange, whether with a magnifying glass or a laptop.

    <h2>There is much to discover.</h2>
    As with watches, it is important not to stand still.
