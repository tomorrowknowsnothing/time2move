    <p>Welcome to my space to practice,
      <br>be creative and build my own projects from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>This is my first attempt at creating a static website since 2012. 
      <br>The last one I created was for a school assignment.
    </p>

    <h2>Precision is my craft.</h2>
    <p>
      As a <span class="watchmaker">master watchmaker</span>, I value accuracy, patience, 
      <br>
      and a keen eye for detail above all else.
      <br>
      This shapes me both professionally and personally.
      <br>
      In addition to watchmaking, I am interested in IT, music, 
      and <a href="greentext.html">coffee</a> culture.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am fascinated by the combination of mechanics and modern technology,
      <br>
      and I find it exciting to see how systems are put together and how they work.
      <br>
      This curiosity has been with me for a long time and is constantly growing.
      <br>
      I look forward to the exchange, whether with a magnifying glass or a laptop. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>I love to learn new things</h2>
    <p>
        I am on my way to becoming a 
        <span class="fullstack">full-stack engineer</span>
        <br>
        and hope to find my place in IT. Peferably as a 
        <br> <i>Computer Science Expert Subject Area: System Integration</i>.

    <h2>There is much to discover.</h2>
      As with watches, it is important not to stand still.
